The **Grandma-Project** is a responsive website for a sweet store built using Bootstrap 4 and a bit of JavaScript. Key features include:

- **Nav Bar**: Contains a logo, links, and a cart icon. Clicking the cart shows or hides items, with options to clear or checkout.
- **Hero Section**: Includes a title and button.
- **About Section**: Features text and an image, with a hover effect that changes the outline. On smaller screens, it switches to a one-column layout.
- **Store Section**: Displays product buttons and a search bar. Items have hover effects, showing a box shadow, card details, price, and name. Layout adjusts based on screen size.
- **Services Section**: Explains what the store offers, with a parallax effect where the background image stays fixed while the text scrolls. Images have a linear gradient overlay.
- **Order Cake Section**: Displays three types of cakes—birthday, custom, and wedding—with prices and descriptions.
- **Footer**: Contains social media icons and the store's address.

Throughout the project, a responsive design is maintained. The cart functionality allows users to add, remove, and view items, with options to clear the cart and checkout.
